<p>This provides an overview and documentation of the <em>eea</em> framework (<em>entities, events, and actions</em>)
that provides a simplification and abstraction layer on top of the <a href="http://slick.cokeandcode.com">Slick</a>
Java game programming framework.</p>

<p>The framework can be separated into three main conceptual components:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Entities</dt>
<dd>Entities are used to represent the elements used in the game (e.g., player and other objects).</dd>
<dt>Actions</dt>
<dd>are thinks that take place on entities and/or modify them. For example, movement, rotation or state changes are possible
actions to be taken on a given entity.</dd>
<dt>Events</dt>
<dd>Events are used to detect if "something interesting/relevant" has happened from the perspective of the current entity.
Once something "interesting and relevant" has been detected, all actions associated with the event will take place.
